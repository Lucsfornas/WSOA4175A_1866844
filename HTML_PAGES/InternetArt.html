                I would like to focus my internet artwork project on animation in the 3d space of the website. i have
                already began experimenting with animating a loading circle type of object which i plan on bringing into
                a 3d caracel type of enviroment. the work will also be programmed and animated in the way that it
                changes colour on user interaction. i further plan to use interactivity to change and alter the shapes,
                colours and sizing of the work itself. my thinking behind the work is that i want it to always be in
                motion and react in a way that is not expected by the user when it is interacted with. i plan on
                randomizing the effects and translations that happen to the work when it is clicked on. so that the user
                does not know how it will look next. for example when the glowing circle that moves (in my first
                experiment) is clicked on it could change into a glowing square, or triangle etc. and the 3d carosel
                effect could randomly change its orientation to vertical, horizontal or vertical.
